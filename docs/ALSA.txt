Raspbian Stretch - Updating alsa options
    All we have to do is tell Raspbian to look at "card #1" for the default audio. 
    Card #0 is the built in audio, so this is fairly straightforward.

    Type sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf and look for the following two lines:
        defaults.ctl.card 0
        defaults.pcm.card 0
    Change both “0” to “1” and then save the file. That’s it!
