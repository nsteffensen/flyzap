If connected via the UART and needing to get WiFi:

<This is a wpasupplicant.conf FAIL?>

sudo raspi-config
 - Localisation Options > Locale 
    x One website says set to "none" whch is not an option
    x Another says check with sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
    -> Another says: locale: en_US.UTF-8  // default locale: en_US.UTF-8
        (I like this one.  Also uncheck en_GB.UTF-8)

- Localisation Options > WLAN country = Use
- sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID
- sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and add to end:
        network={
            ssid="testing"
            psk="testingPassword"
        }
- wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure

Verify with:
- ifconfig wlan0
- If the inet addr field has an address beside it, the Raspberry Pi has connected to the network.
